# What should I do with my break?

This is a simple app built with vanilla JavaScript to help me figure out what to do with my breaks.

I got the fancy toggler from [here](https://www.cssscript.com/realistic-ios-switch-pure-css/).

I'm most proud of the fact that I use a binary decision making tree to avoid having a huge if/else statement.

Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
